> "Info finance is a discipline in which you (i) start with a fact you want to know and (ii) deliberately design a market to optimally elicit that information from market participants." â€” Vitalik Buterin, *From Prediction Markets to Info Finance*

We propose the development of a **browser extension equipped with AI capabilities** to dynamically determine **the semantic structure of websites visited by users**. This tool will parse these sites into semantic segments in real-time and store them in **decentralized storage**.

Users will be incentivized with **reward tokens** for the data they contribute.

The parsed data and Semantic Schemes of websites offer numerous applications. These datasets can be leveraged by AI for model training, while communities can utilize them to ensure message availability and implement new functionalities, such as prediction markets within social networks.

Additional functionalities can be integrated into the semantic schema, enhancing user interfaces dynamically and enabling a Mutable Web that is governed by communities.

# Why AI crawler for social?

## We provide economic incentives for data scraping, aggregation and consumption

You can use your AI agent:
- Analyze conversations happening now
- Find what matters in the web3 chaos
- Deliver insights to your Agent

The AI Crawler is a helpful tool that rewards people for collecting and organizing online information. **Think of it as a smart assistant that helps gather useful data from across the internet.** This makes it easier for businesses and individuals to find and use the information they need to make better decisions.

What makes the AI Crawler special is how it works with your AI agent. As you browse the internet, it automatically reads and understands conversations happening on different websites (Twitter, Forum developer like stack overflow, even Medium Blog...).

# KEY FEATURES
![FEATURE I AI](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/1957fa80b8fd603a42f082841f5ac9fa.png)

AICrawler uses something called a Semantic Scheme to understand website content. The AI helps create this scheme, which acts like a map of how the website is organized.

After collecting the data, AICrawler saves it in secure storage. When someone wants to use this data, they can go to our fly explorer website and chat with data. Here is how RAG works on chain.

One of our best features is the ability to visualize data relationships through on-chain graphs. Our AI crawler summarizes and labels content, and as more data gets verified, your AI agent becomes more powerful.

The third is integrated with Sonic contract to create bounty. These bounties are incentives for crawler and help provide more rewards when crawling data.
